# Quantitative Fractography Image Segmentation

This repository is created to present the training process and the predictions results that are published on the scientific research work: _" Toward quantitative fractography using convolutional neural networks "_.

The source code is a modification of the code published at [image-segmentation-keras](https://github.com/divamgupta/image-segmentation-keras), with the addition of some extra tools needed for the training process.
