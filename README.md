# Quantitative Fractography Image Segmentation

This repository is created to present the training process and the predictions results that are published on the scientific research work: _" Toward quantitative fractography using convolutional neural networks "_.

The source code is a modification of the code published at [image-segmentation-keras](https://github.com/divamgupta/image-segmentation-keras), with the addition of some extra tools needed for the training process. 

The main objective of publishing this work is to propose a new method for the topographic charactirization of fracture surfaces based on Convolutional Neural Networks and attract the interest of the Fractography research community in order to built on this basis and develop tools that optimize the Quantitative Fractogrphy techniques.
