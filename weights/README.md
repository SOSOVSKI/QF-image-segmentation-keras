This folder contains the __.hdf5__ file of the weights that have trained during the training process. 
It can be defined whether the weights are saved after each training epoch or only the weights of the epoch with the highest accuracy, by changing the parameters in the **_ModelCheckpoint()_** Keras function ( _line 101 of the train.py script_ )
